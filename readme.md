# Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Dylan, and I mostly just create small C# applications in my spare time. Coding in my work is mostly JavaScript, and I have occasionally worked with VBScript (in older applications) and C#. I have a great passion for programming and hope to share my creations here as they're developed.
